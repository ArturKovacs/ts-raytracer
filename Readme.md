## About

This is a small frontend application that displays a simple 3D scene using ray-tracing.

The ray-tracing part is implemented in TypeScript. Why? Mostly to see if my new computer can run this in real-time and it can.

If the code looks janky at points it's for performance reasons (and definitley not because I'm lazy or I write ugly code). But seriously: there are a few places for example where I had to introudce variables to gain a significant increase in speed.

## Setup and run

Setup:
```
npm i
```

Run:
```
npm run dev
```

Then visit the URL shown in your terminal.
